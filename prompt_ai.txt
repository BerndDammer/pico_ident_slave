program for raspberry pi pico.
use raspberry pi c/c++ sdk.
gpio 22 is set as open collector.
it recieves at gpio 26 eight bytes and answers with 8 bytes on the same line.
the bit clock is 1 Megaherz.
the bit sequence is 4 Startbits, 8 Databits with LSB first and 2 stoppbits.
One pio unit shall be used for bit generation,
The byte are transferred into ram by dma.
after finishing the dma read an intrerrupt is generated and the answer is transmitted by dma to the pio and clocked out by a pio program.

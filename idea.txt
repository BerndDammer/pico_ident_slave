Requirements
-----------------

Some cards on a bus with one cpu and more periperals make an initial autoconfiguration.
Only one pin on each card is used.
All connected by open collector.
All dialogs are initiated by the cpu.
Each card has a 64 bit unique identifier.

The Bus has only all parallel winding.
No special wiring or electronics.

----

Implementation Details
-------------------
Master clock 1MHz

Can be implemented by Raspi Pico with one PIO unit.
Can be implemented by fpga. (????)
Elements to be configured differ on which bus is simulated.

Command sequence
--------------------
The first byte from CPU defines how many data byte are transmitted 
after and how many reaction bytes are expected from the slaves.

The quiet line is high means a one

CPU Transmit byte:

 0 0 0 1 D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 1 1

A one after 3 0´s defines a write sequence
The 0 1 after third 0 gives the slaves a timing sync edge

CPU Recieve byte:

 0 0 0 0 1 D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 1 1

A one after 4 0´s defines a read sequence
The 0 1 after 4 0´s gives the slaves a timing sync edge

All slaves but their bytes on the line.
The byte on the line is the wired and of all connected slaves.
If a slave want to put NOTHING in the answer, he has to answer with all 1´s.
(necessary to hold all in sync).

The CPU waits at least 5us between command and command data.
The CPU waits at least 10us between request and answer.
